The Thouthe Kodel is supposed to have a rich red color that it gets from the dry byadgi red chillies, but you can use regular dry red chillies as well, like I did. By using the regular red chillies, the color of the curry will not be rich red. The curry also gets its full-bodied flavor from the roasted condiments like fenugreek, coriander, cumin that is ground along with garlic and coconut making the Thouthe Kodel rich, flavorful and delicious.",

After the first whistle, turn the heat to low and simmer the dal for about 3 to 4 minutes. After 3 to 4 minutes, turn off the heat.

In a large sauce pan; add in the cooked and whisked dal, the cucumber tamarind curry and the masala paste. Stir well to combine all the ingredients. Place the sauce pan on medium heat and give the Thouthe Kodel a boil. Once it begins to boil, turn the heat to low and simmer until we get the seasoning ready.To prepare the seasoning for the Thouthe Kodel; heat oil in a small pan; add all the seasoning ingredients.

This will take about 2 minutes.Once everything is roasted well, cool it completely and grind into fine powder using a mixer grinder.If you are adding peanuts, add them last after all the other spices are finely powdered. Otherwise, the powder becomes oily. Keep the powder aside to stuff in the brinjals.Next, wash and pat dry the small brinjals thoroughly. Slit brinjals in such a way that you see an X at the base. Be careful not to slit open them completely.In a bowl, add water with salt and immerse the brinjals in salt water for 5 minutes.In a heavy bottomed pan, add half of the water, required salt and gently drop brinjals when water starts to boil. Make sure there is only one layer of brinjals. Do not put one brinjal over the other.Cook covered until brinjals are 80% done. This will not take more than 6 to 10 minutes. Now, add tamarind paste. If there is not enough water left, add some more water. Mix and cook for another 2 or 3 minutes until brinjals absorb all the salt and tamarind flavours. Remove from pan, cool them completely. Drain the remaining water.In the meantime, take a regular sewing thread, measure the length equal to twice the diameter of brinjals and cut into 10 or 12 pieces. After the brinjals are cooled down, stuff them with spice powder and wrap the thread around them gently. This ensures the spice powder does not come out while frying. Heat oil in the same wide pan, fry urad dal until golden and add curry leaves. Fry until crisp and gently place stuffed and secured brinjals in the pan. Fry the brinjals until they are completely cooked. Sprinkle the remaining spice powder on the top.Turn the brinjals gently using a fork and and a spoon. Do not use a ladle as it may break the brinjals.Once the brinjals are soft and cooked properly, remove the thread carefully and serve hot.Serve Menthi Vankaya along with Mixed Vegetable Sambar, Steamed Rice and Elai Vadam for a satisfying South Indian lunch with your family"

Traditionally, the dals are soaked for 24 hours, changing water every 8 hours.When you are ready to prepare the dal, after sufficient soaking time, take a heavy bottom pan (or a slow cooker) and bring 5 cups of water with a dash of salt, to boil in it.Add the pre soaked dal and rajma to it and let it simmer till it cooks and turns a little soft. This could take anywhere between 2-3 hours as the dal gets it flavours from the slow cooking process. However, if you are in a hurry you can use the pressure cooker to hasten the process.Next, add the tomato and ginger to the dal. Once the dal is cooked, mash the dal and tomatoes a little bit. Take care not to make it mushy, but just achieve a thick consistency. Cook the dal for more 3 to 4 minutes.In a small pan, warm some ghee, add the cumin seeds and sauté till they turn slightly brown. Add dry red chillies, coriander powder, garam masala powder and roast on a low heat for 1 minute taking care not to burn them.Pour this tempering over the the dal and bring it to a boil.

Cut the mangoes in half, deseed and further cut them into one inch cubes. You can leave the skin on provided they are tender and smooth. In a large steel bowl, combine the salt, turmeric powder and cut mangoes. Cover, the bowl and allow it to marinate for 1 hour.Heat a small pan on medium heat, and roast the coriander seeds until you start smelling the aroma. Turn off heat and allow it to cool. Once cooled, using a pestle and mortar to coarsely crush the coriander seeds to half.Blend the mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds into a coarse powder. There is no need to roast the seeds.To the marinated mangoes, add the powdered mustard and fenugreek seeds, red chilli powder, fennel seeds, kalonji seeds, and coriander seeds. Stir well to combine.Add 1 cup of mustard oil and stir well again. You don't need to heat the mustard oil. Check the salt at this stage. It should feel extra salt. If it is not extra salty, add a few tablespoon of salt until you get that extra salty taste. Salt and oil are the two most important preservatives in pickling. Cover the steel bowl with a muslin cloth and tie it tightly around the rim. This will absorb any residual moisture. Place a steel lid over the covered bowl and set aside.After 24 hours, open and give it a stir. Cover again with cloth wrapped tightly and a lid and set it to rest for another day. The third day you will notice the mangoes have softened. At this stage add the remaining 2 cups of mustard oil. Give it a stir. Once again cover tightly with muslin cloth and a steel lid. Keep it aside for 2 more days. Give it a stir.By the end of 5th day the pickle will be ready to eat. The mangoes would have softened but might still have a firm texture. The mangoes will keep marinating and softening when it is stored in bottles and will age with time. Moisture is the biggest killer for pickles. Clean and sterilize the bottles and the lids that you will be using for storage. I typically like to store them in multiple small 500 gram glass bottles, so I only open the bottle when i am ready to use it.Transfer the Punjabi Mango Pickle into the clean and dry bottles. Add a tablespoon of mustard oil on the top once filled and seal the bottle tight and enjoy.Use a clean dry spoon so that there is no moisture when you take the pickle out of the bottle.Serve Punjabi Mango Pickle  with Pyaz Ka Paratha Recipe or Aloo Methi Paratha Recipe for a  complete breakfast."

After an hour, wash the chopped bitter gourd thoroughly and keep aside to drain. Use a little oil and roast the bitter gourd rings on low heat in a kadai till crisp. Peel and clean the Ambade meanwhile when the bitter gourd is roasting on low heat. Heat a little oil in a kadai (a few drops each time) and lightly roast the coriander seeds, urad dal, methi seeds, rice grains, peppercorns, asafoetida piece and dry red chillies separately on low heat.As soon as each ingredient changes its colour, remove from flame and keep aside to cool.Once cooled, grind all these ingredients in a mixer grinder along with the grated coconut, using required water to form a smooth paste. Add to this paste to a cup of water and mix well to form a semi-thick gravy and pour in the kadai.Now, add turmeric powder, ambade/hog plum/amtekai, jaggery, roasted bitter gourd rings, salt to taste and keep on a high heat stirring occasionally till it reaches boiling point. Once it starts boiling, lower the heat and simmer for about 8-10 minutes or till the ambade are cooked and soft. If you feel that the gravy has thickened too much by now, just add some water to bring back a medium consistency which is desirable.Check for seasoning and adjust salt and jaggery if required. In a tadka pan, heat a bit of oil for tempering and when the oil is hot, add mustard seeds and asafoetida. Pour this over the prepared udid methi.Serve Karwar Style Ambade Udid Methi Recipe (Hog Plum Curry) along with Steamed Rice and Sol Kadhi for a South Indian meal."

Sauté for a few seconds.Immediately add 2 cups of bean sprouts, turmeric powder and salt to taste; give it a good stir.Sprinkle some water and close the pan with a tight lid. Let the sprouts cook in its own steam.As soon as the sprouts are cooked to the texture you like (some people prefer it soft and some with still a bite in it, like the way I do), stir in the grated coconut.Heat through for about a minute and remove from heat. Serve hot.Serve Moong Bean Sprouts Upkari Recipe along with Methi Chaman and Phulkas for a weekday meal with family."

So soldiers would bury the prepared dough into smaller chunks and place it underground. The blistering heat of Rajasthan, with the sun beating down on the earth would cook the dumplings, and by the time the soldiers returned after a long dar’s war, they would have perfectly earth-baked abates ready for a meal.",

If the dough turns out a touch hard to stiff, add a little milk and knead it till soft to touch.Divide the dough into equal sized portions, place them in a platter or tray. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for half an hour.Meanwhile proceed to prepare the masala filling. For this, place a pan on the heat. Add some oil to it and allow it to get warm. Then add cumin seeds, onions and green chilies to the oil and sauté until onions turn light pink.Next, add ginger garlic paste, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, roasted cumin powder and salt to the onions and toss it together. Stir continuously as it cooks, until the raw smell of the spices goes away.Then add peas and cook for 3 minutes until all the ingredients have combined together. Add water to cook the peas, if required, but once they are cooked, cook it till the excess water has evaporated completely.Once peas is cooked and water is completely dry, turn off the heat and set the masala aside so it can cool completely.Now, to make the baatis. Take one portion at a time, and flatten it into a small disc about 2-3 inches in diameter, and keep it in your palm. Scoop some peas masala filling, place it in the center of the disc. Then, bring the ends together, encasing the filling in the centre, seal the opening by pinching the edges together.Press the ball slightly and make a small depression with your thumb, in the center of the ball. Repeat with all the portions of dough.Then, place a heavy bottomed pot on the heat with about 3 litres of water in it. Bring the water to a boil, turn the heat down and gently slide the baatis into the water. Allow them to cook on a low heat for 15 to 20 minutes until they cook and rise to the top.Meanwhile, pre-heat the oven at 200 degrees centigrade.When the baatis are cooked, drain them gently and place them in a platter to cool.Once cooled, place the battis on on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and place the sheet in the oven.Bake the masala stuffed battis at 200 degrees for about 25 to 35 minutes, turning them over every 10 minutes to ensure an evenly baked through and golden brown in color.Once they’re golden brown and crisp, remove the masala battis baking sheet from the oven and place it on a baking tray to cool slightly.Serve the Baked Whole Wheat Masala Baati while still hot, with ghee. If you are calorie conscious, you can have it with Panchmel Dal, with just a light drizzle of ghee as a meal, or as a light evening snack along with a cup of tea."

The level of water should be an inch above the rice in the bowl. Let it soak for about 6 hours or overnight. Soak the urad dal and fenugreek in water such that all of the dal is completely immersed in water. The level of water should be 2 inches above the dal in the bowl. Let it soak for about 6 hours.After the soaking period, first grind the urad dal into a fine smooth batter. While grinding add just enough water to make it into a very smooth batter. The batter will look fluffy.Grind the rice, ragi, barley into a smooth batter, adding just the required amount of water to grind into an almost smooth batter. Adding too much water will make the mixture too watery. If required grind a little at a time to get a  smooth batter .Combine the urad and rice ragi batter, add salt to taste and set aside for at least 12 hours or overnight until the ragi idli dosa batter ferments.

Precooking the Manoli (Indian Gherkins) makes the cooking process faster and more nutritious too.I like to use a pressure cooker for steaming the vegetables. To do this, place the cut Manoli (Indian Gherkins) along with a pinch of salt and 2 tablespoons of water into the pressure cooker.Cover the pan, place the weight on and allow the vegetable to cook in the pressure cooker until you hear two whistles.  After a whistle, turn off the heat and you can place the pressure cooker under running water to release the pressure immediately. Releasing the pressure immediately, helps retain the fresh green color of the Gherkins and also gives it a perfectly cooked texture.Click here to watch the video of how to cook vegetables in a pressure cooker.Our next step is to make the Manoli Curry Masala. In a small pan; roast the dry red chillies, fenugreek, coriander, cumin and black pepper until you can smell the roasted aromas. Add these to a small blender jar, along with the coconut, tamarind and turmeric powder.Grind the spices adding very little water to make a smooth curry paste. The Manoli curry paste is now ready. Keep aside.In the next step; heat a teaspoon of oil in a pan; add the chopped onions, and saute for a couple of minutes until the onions are soft and tender. Add the curry paste and saute for a couple of more minutes.Stir in the steamed gherkins, salt and add about 1-1/2 to 2 cups of water. You essentially want a thick gravy for the Manoli Curry; hence add water accordingly. Give all the ingredients a good stir. Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste. Give the mixture a quick boil only when you are ready to serve. Serve the Mangalorean Manoli Curry Recipe along with Whole Wheat Lachha Paratha and Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita for an everyday meal."

        "instructions": "To begin making Cauliflower Paneer Kofta Curry Recipe place big pot on the heat. Add 1 liter of water into the pot and bring it to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the boiling water and turn off the heat.Next, to chop up the cauliflower, first remove the stem and leafy parts of the cauliflower and immerse it into the just-boiled, hot water. Allow the cauliflower sit for about 3 to 4 minutes. Then remove it from hot water, and place it on a kitchen towel. Pat it dry completely.Now grate the cauliflower completely and set it aside for a while. After about 10 minutes, cauliflower would have released a lot of water, squeeze it out and discard the water.Next, heat a pan and dry roast the grated cauliflower until it feels completely dry and contains no more moisture. While roasting it, take care not to cook it too much. It should not change to brown, so it is best to roast it on a low flame.Once the cauliflower is completely dry, take it off the heat, transfer it into a cool dish and allow it to come down to room temperature.Add the grated paneer to the cooled cauliflower. Add in the mashed potatoes, and all the spices along with corn flour. Knead well until everything is mixed. Make small lemon sized balls of the mix and arrange them on a plate. Set them aside till further use.Next, we need to fry the koftas. Warm some oil in a pan, when oil is hot enough, deep fry the koftas until evenly golden brown. For an oil-free version, you could also bake them in a pre-heated oven, or use a kuzhi-paniyaram pan to pan-fry them. Either way, lay the golden brown koftas onto kitchen paper once they are browned on all sides.To prepare the curry, first warm some oil or butter in a pan. Add the shahi jeera and fry for a minute. Next add the finely chopped onions and fry them till translucent. Add the tomato puree and cook it together until the puree thickens and begins to leave the sides of the pan.At this stage, add all the spice powders and mix well. Then add water as required and bring the curry to boil.Turn the heat down, add the cream, mix well and finally add the fried kofta balls. Simmer on low heat for about 3 to 4 minutes.Turn off the heat, garnish the curry with the reserved cream and fresh coriander leaves.Serve Cauliflower Paneer Kofta Curry  with Phulkas, Dal Tadka and Chana Dal Pulao along with a Urad Dal Raita for a comforting, yet special homely meal."

Take one portion and dust in dry flour. Roll the dough to make a 3-4 inch diameter circle. Place 2 tablespoons of the filling in the center on the circle and bring the dough edges together towards the center. Seal the edges of the dough and pinch out any excess dough from the stuffed paratha.Flatten the paratha with your fingers, dust it in flour once again and roll the paratha applying very gentle pressure to make a 5 to 6 inch diameter circle.Proceed the same way with the remaining dough portions and stuff with the filling and roll into a paratha.Our next step is to cook the paratha; for this preheat a skillet (roti tawa) (preferably iron skillet).When the skillet is hot; place the stuffed rolled our paratha on the skillet and cook for a minute on both sides until you notice a few brown spots appear.When you notice the brown spots, smear some ghee or oil on both sides and cook until the paratha has turned golden brown and lightly crisp on both sides. Cook on medium and not high heat as you want the paratha to get cooked evenly. Once the paratha is done, place it on a platter and proceed to cook the remaining parathas.Serve Broccoli and Paneer paratha with pickle of your choice and Tomato Onion Cucumber Raita Recipe and a hot cup of Adrak Chai ."

        "description": "Maharashtrian Amti Recipe is one of the most simple yet flavourful recipes from the region. It is a traditional recipe and every Maharastrian family has their own way of making amti. A staple at mealtimes, amti is rather simple yet tasteful preparation of lentils (dal) that emerged from the Vidharbha region. It gets its distinct taste from being a gentle blend of spicy, a little sweet and a little tangy flavours. Amti-bhaat-bhaji (translated as lentil/dal, rice and vegetables) is served as a meal. A special masala called amti masala, quite similar to goda masala is used in making this amti. This recipe uses goda masala for convenience. Amti is best served with fresh steamed rice and a dollop of ghee.",

Drain the remaining water.In the meantime, take a regular sewing thread, measure the length equal to twice the diameter of brinjals and cut into 10 or 12 pieces. After the brinjals are cooled down, stuff them with spice powder and wrap the thread around them gently.

Traditionally, the dals are soaked for 24 hours, changing water every 8 hours.When you are ready to prepare the dal, after sufficient soaking time, take a heavy bottom pan (or a slow cooker) and bring 5 cups of water with a dash of salt, to boil in it.Add the pre soaked dal and rajma to it and let it simmer till it cooks and turns a little soft. This could take anywhere between 2-3 hours as the dal gets it flavours from the slow cooking process. However, if you are in a hurry you can use the pressure cooker to hasten the process.Next, add the tomato and ginger to the dal. Once the dal is cooked, mash the dal and tomatoes a little bit. Take care not to make it mushy, but just achieve a thick consistency. Cook the dal for more 3 to 4 minutes.In a small pan, warm some ghee, add the cumin seeds and sauté till they turn slightly brown. Add dry red chillies, coriander powder, garam masala powder and roast on a low heat for 1 minute taking care not to burn them.Pour this tempering over the the dal and bring it to a boil.

Add in additional water so that the water level is atleast 2 inches above the soaked Kala Chana.Give it a good stir and cover the pressure cooker and place its weight on. Cook the kala Chana in the pressure cooker until you hear 4 to 5 whistles. After 4 to 5 whistles, turn the heat to low and simmer the chana for another 15 minutes and then turn off the heat.Allow the pressure to release naturally. This will take another 15 minutes. Once the pressure releases naturally, open the cooker, add in the sauteed spinach and give it a good stir.Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste. Gently mash the chickpeas little bit with the back of the ladle to thicken the gravy little bit and the Palak Kala Chana Sukhi Recipe is ready to be served.Serve the Palak & Kala Chana Sukhi Sabzi Recipe along with Dal Tadka, Dill Cucumber Raita, Jeera Rice and Phulka for a delicious weekday meal."

    "instructions": "To begin making the  Punjabi Mango Pickle recipe (Aam Ka Achaar Recipe), wash the mangoes and dry them completely making sure there is no moisture or dust.Make sure your knife and the platform you use for cutting the mangoes is clean and moisture free. Cut the mangoes in half, deseed and further cut them into one inch cubes. You can leave the skin on provided they are tender and smooth. In a large steel bowl, combine the salt, turmeric powder and cut mangoes. Cover, the bowl and allow it to marinate for 1 hour.Heat a small pan on medium heat, and roast the coriander seeds until you start smelling the aroma. Turn off heat and allow it to cool. Once cooled, using a pestle and mortar to coarsely crush the coriander seeds to half.Blend the mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds into a coarse powder. There is no need to roast the seeds.To the marinated mangoes, add the powdered mustard and fenugreek seeds, red chilli powder, fennel seeds, kalonji seeds, and coriander seeds. Stir well to combine.Add 1 cup of mustard oil and stir well again. You don't need to heat the mustard oil. Check the salt at this stage. It should feel extra salt. If it is not extra salty, add a few tablespoon of salt until you get that extra salty taste. Salt and oil are the two most important preservatives in pickling. Cover the steel bowl with a muslin cloth and tie it tightly around the rim. This will absorb any residual moisture. Place a steel lid over the covered bowl and set aside.After 24 hours, open and give it a stir. Cover again with cloth wrapped tightly and a lid and set it to rest for another day. The third day you will notice the mangoes have softened. At this stage add the remaining 2 cups of mustard oil. Give it a stir. Once again cover tightly with muslin cloth and a steel lid. Keep it aside for 2 more days. Give it a stir.By the end of 5th day the pickle will be ready to eat. The mangoes would have softened but might still have a firm texture. The mangoes will keep marinating and softening when it is stored in bottles and will age with time. Moisture is the biggest killer for pickles. Clean and sterilize the bottles and the lids that you will be using for storage. I typically like to store them in multiple small 500 gram glass bottles, so I only open the bottle when i am ready to use it.Transfer the Punjabi Mango Pickle into the clean and dry bottles. Add a tablespoon of mustard oil on the top once filled and seal the bottle tight and enjoy.Use a clean dry spoon so that there is no moisture when you take the pickle out of the bottle.Serve Punjabi Mango Pickle  with Pyaz Ka Paratha Recipe or Aloo Methi Paratha Recipe for a  complete breakfast. "

    "description": "Baked Whole Wheat Masala Baati is a traditional Rajasthani recipe for a crusty baked dumpling-shaped cookie made of whole wheat kneaded together with spices. It has a fascinating origin, dating back to the ancient days when soldiers ate it as a staple war-time sustenance. During those days grains like wheat, jowar, bajra were a part of everyday meal. So soldiers would bury the prepared dough into smaller chunks and place it underground. The blistering heat of Rajasthan, with the sun beating down on the earth would cook the dumplings, and by the time the soldiers returned after a long dar’s war, they would have perfectly earth-baked abates ready for a meal.",

    "instructions": "To begin making the Whole Wheat Masala Baati, first mix all ingredients mentioned under the ‘For baatis’ in a large mixing bowl.Knead them all together to form a soft dough that is pliable, but not sticky. If the dough turns out a touch hard to stiff, add a little milk and knead it till soft to touch.Divide the dough into equal sized portions, place them in a platter or tray. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for half an hour.Meanwhile proceed to prepare the masala filling. For this, place a pan on the heat. Add some oil to it and allow it to get warm. Then add cumin seeds, onions and green chilies to the oil and sauté until onions turn light pink.Next, add ginger garlic paste, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, roasted cumin powder and salt to the onions and toss it together. Stir continuously as it cooks, until the raw smell of the spices goes away.Then add peas and cook for 3 minutes until all the ingredients have combined together. Add water to cook the peas, if required, but once they are cooked, cook it till the excess water has evaporated completely.Once peas is cooked and water is completely dry, turn off the heat and set the masala aside so it can cool completely.Now, to make the baatis. Take one portion at a time, and flatten it into a small disc about 2-3 inches in diameter, and keep it in your palm. Scoop some peas masala filling, place it in the center of the disc. Then, bring the ends together, encasing the filling in the centre, seal the opening by pinching the edges together.Press the ball slightly and make a small depression with your thumb, in the center of the ball. Repeat with all the portions of dough.Then, place a heavy bottomed pot on the heat with about 3 litres of water in it. Bring the water to a boil, turn the heat down and gently slide the baatis into the water. Allow them to cook on a low heat for 15 to 20 minutes until they cook and rise to the top.Meanwhile, pre-heat the oven at 200 degrees centigrade.When the baatis are cooked, drain them gently and place them in a platter to cool.Once cooled, place the battis on on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and place the sheet in the oven.Bake the masala stuffed battis at 200 degrees for about 25 to 35 minutes, turning them over every 10 minutes to ensure an evenly baked through and golden brown in color.Once they’re golden brown and crisp, remove the masala battis baking sheet from the oven and place it on a baking tray to cool slightly.Serve the Baked Whole Wheat Masala Baati while still hot, with ghee. If you are calorie conscious, you can have it with Panchmel Dal, with just a light drizzle of ghee as a meal, or as a light evening snack along with a cup of tea."

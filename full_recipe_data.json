            "preparation": "To begin making the Onion Vada Sambar Recipe;  we will first soak the dal for about 3 hours.Using a strainer, strain all the excess water from the urad dal. We need to use very little water to grind the urad dal, so that you can shape them well if you are deep frying.Next we will grind the dal, along with ginger and green chillies using a food processor or a mixer grinder into a very smooth batter. Make sure add very little water while grinding the dal to make a smooth batter. Transfer the batter to a bowl. Add in the chopped onions, coriander leaves into the batter. Stir well to combine the ingredients well into the vada batter.Next we will preheat the Kuzhi Paniyaram Pan and add in a little oil into each cavity; once the pan is well heated spoon the mini onion vada mixture into each of the cavities. Cover the pan and allow it to steam until you notice that the top looks cooked. After a couple minutes of steaming of notice the top part of the mini onion vada looks cooked. At this point you could add a little more oil and then flip the vada so it can get cooked and crisp from both sides. This time, allow it to cook without the cover. Transfer the Mini Onion Vadas to a platter and continue the same process with the remaining batter.To make the Vengaya Sambar recipe, pressure cook the toor dal along with 2 cups of water for 3 to 4 whistles and turn off the heat. Once the pressure releases naturally, open the cooking and mash the toor dal until soft. Keep aside.Into a pressure cooker; add the tamarind water, onions, radish, carrot, sambar powder and salt.

Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough.Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the paratha dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead a little more. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky. Divide the dough into equal portions.Cover the ragi paratha dough and allow it to rest until you get the filling ready. The next step is to make the Paneer filling for the Ragi ParathaIn a mixing bowl, combine the grated paneer green chillies, freshly chopped mint leaves, salt to taste, cumin powder, Using your fingers again, mix all the ingredients well.Divide the filling into equal portions.This process of dividing and keeping the portions for paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.The final step is to stuff the filling into the ragi paratha dough.Dust the ragi paratha dough in flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter.Take a portion of paneer filling and place it in the center. Next gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together. Remove the little excess dough which popped out when you brought them together. Press the filled ragi paneer paratha dough down.Dust the filled paneer paratha dough in some flour and roll it gently applying just a pressure. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of paratha dough and filling.Preheat skillet on medium heat and grease it with little oil. Place the filled ragi paneer paratha. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over.Spread a little oil over the paratha and keep pressing the ragi paneer stuffed parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out.Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture.Once the Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the same process with the remaining parathas the same way.Serve this Paneer Stuffed Ragi Paratha Recipe along with Spring Onion and Peanut Raita Recipe and Amla Achaar Recipe for a hearty and healthy high protein breakfast or an indian diabetic breakfast or lunch."

However, if you are in a hurry you can use the pressure cooker to hasten the process.Next, add the tomato and ginger to the dal. Once the dal is cooked, mash the dal and tomatoes a little bit. Take care not to make it mushy, but just achieve a thick consistency. Cook the dal for more 3 to 4 minutes.In a small pan, warm some ghee, add the cumin seeds and sauté till they turn slightly brown. Add dry red chillies, coriander powder, garam masala powder and roast on a low heat for 1 minute taking care not to burn them.Pour this tempering over the the dal and bring it to a boil. Simmer it for another 10-15 minutes and serve hot.Maa Ki Dal can be served with Baingan Ka Bharta, Boondi Raita and Phulka for a comforting Punjabi meal."

Transfer the paste to a bowl and keep aside until required.Now take a 2 tablespoon of the coconut milk and dissolve rice flour to it. Stir to make a lump free smooth mixture. Make sure rice flour is fully dissolved in coconut milk. Add this to the remaining  coconut milk and whisk it all together to form smooth lump free mixture.Next, heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is heated add coconut and coriander paste made earlier to the pan. Stir the paste continuously to avoid sticking to the pan. If still paste sticks to the pan, reduce the flame to low.Pour coconut milk into the paste in the pan along with turmeric. Stir to combine and if you feel the curry seems too thick, you can adjust the consistency adding water.Allow the curry to simmer on a low flame for about 3 to 5 minutes and turn off the heat. Note: You can make the curry and keep it refrigerated and simmer only when you are ready to serve. This way we don't overcook the curry and the nutrition is not lost.
